# Jupyter Boilerplate

This is a small repository containing Jupyter notebooks boilerplate code. There are two files:

* `Header.py` - Contains a header that is a good starting point for many scientific notebooks. You may not find all the imports necessary for your project, nor will you necessarily need all the imports listed. That said, this header imports many of the libraries commonly used in (data) science.
* `Snippets.py` - Contains small snippets of code that can be useful. Each snippet has a comment header. Hopefully, I can keep adding to it. The code or the snippets usually won't run by themselves; they're only meant to be examples.
